Indian Remote Sensing Satellite datasets were used to define land use/land cover in WRF. The accuracy of simulated rainfall and temperature over Punjab and Haryana was evaluated against Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and automated weather station data of Indian Space Research Organization, respectively. Data from WRF was used as weather input to DSSAT to simulate rice yield in Punjab and Haryana for 2009 and 2014. After simulated yield has been evaluated against district-level observed yield, the water balance components within the DSSAT model were used to analyze the impact of water stress on rice yield. The correlation (R2) between the crop water stress factor and the rice yield anomaly at the vegetative and reproductive stage was 0.64 and 0.52 for Haryana and 0.73 and 0.68 for Punjab, respectively. Severe water stress during the flowering to maturity stage inflicted devastating effects on yield. The study concludes that the regional climate simulations can be potentially used for early water stress prediction and its impact on rice yield. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"agriculture; climate change; crop; dehydration; forecasting; Oryza; weather; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Dehydration; Forecasting; Oryza; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139528616

Timely, accurate, and reliable rice yield prediction in India is crucial for global food security and health issues. Deep learning models have achieved excellent performances in predicting crop yield. However, the interpretation of deep learning models is still rare. In this study, we proposed a transformer-based model, Informer, to predict rice yield across the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains by integrating time-series satellite data, environmental variables, and rice yield records from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that Informer had better performance (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.41 t/ha) than four other machine learning and deep learning models for end-of-season prediction. For within-season prediction, the Informer model could achieve stable performances (R2 ≈ 0.78) after late September, which indicated that the optimal prediction could be achieved 2 months before rice maturity. In addition, we interpreted the prediction models by evaluating the input feature importance and analyzing hidden features. The evaluation of feature importance indicated that NIRV was the most critical factor, while intervals 6 (mid-August) and 12 (mid-November) were the key periods for rice yield prediction. The hidden feature analysis demonstrated that the attention-based long short-term memory (AtLSTM) model accumulated the information of each growth period, while the Informer model focused on the information around intervals 5 to 6 (August) and 11 to 12 (November). Our findings provided a reliable and simple framework for crop yield prediction and a new perspective for explaining the internal mechanism of deep learning models. © 2022 by the authors.","attention; crop yield prediction; deep learning; feature importance; remote sensing","Crops; Deep learning; Food supply; Learning systems; Remote sensing; Attention; Crop yield; Crop yield prediction; Deep learning; Feature importance; Learning models; Performance; Remote-sensing; Rice yield; Yield prediction; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139943688

Satellite-based remote sensing offers a suitable and cost-effective technique for regional- and national-scale crop monitoring. The use of remote sensing data for crop yield estimation has been demonstrated using a semi-physical approach with reasonable success. Assimilating remote sensing data with the DSSAT model and spectral indices-based regression analysis are promising methods for spatially estimating rice crop yields. Rice area and yield in the Cauvery delta zone of Tamil Nadu, India was estimated during samba (August–January) season in the years 2020–2021 using Sentinel 1A Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite data with three different spatial yield estimation methods, namely a spectral indices-based regression analysis, semi-physical approach, and integrating remote products with DSSAT crop growth model. A rice area map was generated for the study area using a rule-based classifier approach utilizing parameterization with a classification accuracy of 94.5% and a kappa score of 0.89. The total classified rice area in Cauvery Delta Region was 379,767 ha, and the Start of Season (SoS) maps for samba season revealed that the major planting period for rice was between 22 September and 9 November in 2020. The study also aimed to identify promising spatial yield estimation techniques for optimal rice yield prediction over large areas. Regression models resulted in rice yields of 3234 to 3905 kg ha−1 with a mean of 3654 kg ha−1. The net primary product was computed using the periodical PAR, fAPAR, Wstress, Tstress, and maximum radiation use efficiency in a semi-physical approach. The resultant rice yields ranged between 2652 and 3438 kg ha−1 with the mean of 3076 kg ha−1. During the integration of remote sensing products with crop growth models, LAI values were extracted from dB images and utilized to simulate rice yields in the range of 3684 to 4012 kg ha−1 with the mean of 3855 kg ha−1. When compared to the semi-physical approach, both integrating remote sensing products with the DSSAT crop growth model and spectral indices-based regression analysis had R2 greater than 0.80, NRMSE of less than 10%, and agreement of more than 90%, indicating that these two approaches could be used for spatial rice yield estimation. © 2022 by the authors.","crop growth model; fAPAR; remote sensing; rice yield; semi-physical approach; spectral indices; synthetic aperture radar",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138512306

This study is done in June Khed village in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, India to assessing the efficiency of an open source cloud-based remote sensing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE), in the village-scale identification of sugarcane. The ground-truth data was collected and the efficiency of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data was assessed in driving GEE’s inbuilt Machine Learning classifiers: Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). Results were validated with the ground truth data and the official data. Of the methods used, SVM outperformed RF and CART with the lowest relative deviation (+9.2%), highest F1-score (0.8) and overall accuracy (78%), using the Sentinel-2 data. Results also indicated the in-situ use of observation data with high spatio-temporal resolution data. The validated model was then up-scaled for the Walwa Taluka level, to map sugarcane area that can be used for further agriculture tasks such as crop monitoring and yield prediction, leading to better management of crop and better formulating of sugarcane farmer policy. © 2022, Association of Agrometeorologists.

The methodologies used so far for crop yield forecast with remotely sensed data were focused upon vegetation indices generated from optical data. The prediction of crop yield in an accurate manner by developing robust machine learning models based on soil health parameters is crucial since it helps keep a track of soil health as well as its impact on overall yield. This study aims to utilize remotely sensed Microwave satellite data from Sentinel-1 and optical data from Sentinel-2, and field data to estimate three important soil health parameters- Soil Moisture, Soil Salinity, and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC). The study has been carried out in the Rupnagar district of Punjab in India. The estimated soil health parameters, SAR backscatter, and optical remote sensing satellite data parameters were utilized to estimate wheat crop yield. The soil health based DLMLP model performed best in crop yield estimation and gave R2 values of 0.723 and 0.684 in the training and testing phases, respectively, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.98 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 1.24 for the 2019–20 season. The DLMLP test R2 was 42.2% more than the Ordinary Least Squares Regressor (OLS), while the MAE and RMSE were 37.97% and 38.61% less than the OLS regressor for wheat crop yield estimation. The soil health-based DLMLP model gave satisfactory yield estimation accuracy in the absence of validation of soil health parameter values for the preceding years-2015–16 till 2018–19 wheat seasons. This study's novel feature is that it estimates soil health parameters for the early stages of wheat crop growth when soil lies mostly exposed and utilises them for crop yield prediction. © 2022 The Author(s)","Crop yield forecast; Deep Learning Multi-Layer Perceptron (DLMLP); Machine learning; SAR backscatter; Soil health parameters","backscatter; crop production; crop yield; estimation method; machine learning; remote sensing; soil property; synthetic aperture radar; India; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136115022

In this research, remote sensing driven semi-empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model and a process-based crop simulation model (CSM) approach were attempted to predict cotton yield in the five districts of Maharashtra state, India. Time-series satellite data from different earth observation (EO) missions were retrieved from 2011 to 2017. Satellite-based measurements of fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data were directly incorporated into the LUE model. The LUE model approach used observed minimum (0.07) and maximum (0.12) lint harvest index (HI) values to predict the cotton yield. On the other hand, the CSM model was parameterized with observed field management, soil, weather, and cultivar data for crop yield prediction. The inter-evaluation of models has revealed that the LUE model with HI value 0.07 (HI0.07) performed better when compared to the LUE model with HI value 0.12 (HI0.12) and CSM model. LUE model HI0.07 had shown better accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of 154 kg ha−1 and correlation coefficient value of (R2 = 0.46) when compared with LUE model HI0.12 (RMSE 310 kg ha−1 and R2 = 0.41) and CSM model (RMSE 235 kg ha−1 and R2 = 0.38). The predicted yield from the models was found satisfactory for the normal year with acceptable accuracy. However, overestimation of yield was seen for the years affected by drought. This study has shown the potential of geospatial data that can be coupled with crop models to predict the crop yield with limited field observations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cotton; Crop yield; CSM; Drought; LUE; Semi-arid","comparative study; computer simulation; cotton; empirical analysis; numerical model; prediction; remote sensing; India; Maharashtra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106063646

Now with the advent of satellite sensors like the MSI from Sentilnel-2 with fine spatial resolution, the possibility of generating frequent information on crop condition at field scale is increasing. This study demonstrated the combined use of high-resolution data from Sentinel-2 (10 m and 20 m); moderate-resolution data from MODIS (500 m) and coarser-resolution radiation data from INSAT-3D (4 km) for estimating yield of three major crops of India at GP and taluka level using a semi-physical model based on crop-specific radiation use efficiency. The novelty of this study lies in the data fusion approach using parameters from multiple spatial resolution of Geostationary and Lower Earth Orbiting satellites within the basic semi-physical model framework. The methodology has been demonstrated in Cuttack district of Odisha for rice; Rajkot district of Gujarat for cotton; and Indore district of MP and Fatehabad district of Haryana for wheat. We validated our result at GP, taluka and district level. At GP level, the root mean square error (RMSE) was found to be 16.5% for rice and 5.8% for wheat in Indore district.

Due to the rapid urbanization and Agrochemical interventions, plants are infected by insects, pathogens, massive infestations, which leads to the deficiency of growth nutrients and ions, thereby minimizing agricultural crop yield. These infections occur in several forms like aphids, black root rot, cankers, leaf curls, rusts, anthracnose, and blights make agriculture fail to thrive and increase the impact of crop diseases. Since plant disease prevention is a continuous process that occurs regularly, agriculturists follow several strategies to keep their crops disease-free. An efficient monitoring and supporting system for continuous and long-term plant and soil health monitoring is needed to meet the needs of growing population.

The perceived distinctness of the spectral signatures of the materials of interest is exploited for detecting targets in hyperspectral imagery. Space-time varying atmospheric perturbances on the radiation reaching a remote sensor are major limitations for designing a successful TD framework. Incorporating atmospheric components into a target detection framework is vital for practical applicability. Considered a general approach for flexibility, scalability, and optimal prediction, deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly used in various remote sensing applications. However, their potential for TD is relatively unexplored. Especially, the ability to provide training data sufficient for DL models and maintaining the functional relevance of the sparsely distributed targets in hyperspectral imagery are crucial for TD frameworks. This letter presents a novel method for training of DL architecture, called Deep Spectral Target Detector (DSTD). The proposed method includes a semi-supervised multi-scenario forward radiative transfer modelling (RTM) for the simulation of spectral signatures of various targets as training data suitable for the functional requirements of a typical DL architecture. We implemented the DSTD on a TD application-specific benchmark AVIRIS-NG airborne hyperspectral imagery acquired over a study site near Ooty, India. Compared to state-of-art statistical target detectors, the detection performance of the DSTD is superior to equivalent. Further, RTM-based training yields a robust model, impervious to the atmospheric mismatches between target collection and TD environments, indicating the potential for a similar approach to developing efficient DL-based methods for TD in the future.

In this situation, NDVI based crop vegetation parameter described a better relationship with crop yield prediction. NDVI values were acquired from optical Sentinel 2B images during a specific phenological time in 2019 and 2020. Fifty agricultural plots are occupied in an area of 300ha for both rice (Kharif) and potato (Rabi) crops, in Tarakeswar Block, Hooghly district, West Bengal, India. The ordinary kriging technique was used to produce NDVI prediction maps using Arc GIS 10.7 software. For validation of NDVI and conforming crop yield, both the crops were verified through geostatistical techniques with the lowest RMSE values. The positive coefficient of correlation between NDVI and crop yield was found as r2=0.406 for NDVI_rice and r2=0.692 for NDVI_potato, respectively. Further, at semivariograms analysis the lowest nugget-to-sill ratio found 2.51% for rice yield and 1.52% for potato yield, respectively, described the strong spatial autocorrelation. In the other hand, the highest nugget-to-sill ratio found 11.41% for NDVI_rice and 25.52% for NDVI_potato, respectively, representing moderate to strong spatial dependence.

Analysis and prediction of micronutrient of the soil chemical parameters are highly insisted upon by farmers and agriculture researchers. The soil nutrients parameters can be analyzed from multispectral data through ISO cluster unsupervised classification. Understanding the nutrient level of soil is highly recommended for farming; early understanding may help to improve soil fertility and fully meet productivity requirements. This paper addresses the soil nutrients analysis by the regression method and its spectral indexed based on the prediction model by Iterative Self-Organizing (ISO) cluster unsupervised classification algorithm. Therefore, for this study, the Baggi, Ibrahimpur, Wai, Mogra, and Bori (for validation) villages were selected. These villages are located in the Amravati district and fall under Maharashtra provenance of India. From the study area, three soil nutrients parameters such as P, Fe, pH indices-based data were acquired from the spectral calculation of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 bands. The P, Fe and pH indices were calculated from the yellowness index (YI), ferrous oxide index, and carbonate level. The ISO cluster unsupervised mechanism has been used for prediction of soil chemical parameter indices out of 100 samples. The study regions recognition rate is 97% for P, 94.05% for Fe, and 69% for pH. During the validation process, four villages' results were used for the identification of soil nutrient parameters for Bori village. The results of the study area can be helpful for the development of the planning of soil fertility in the agriculture fields and effectively increase the crop yield production in the semi-arid region. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Image index; ISO cluster; Remote sensing; Soil nutrients",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132151296

If a farmer owns a piece of land, the farmer should be aware about the crops that can be grown in the area, the diseases that might affect the crops etc. Growing crops is a tough job because of the involvement of many different factors like soil type, temperature, humidity and so on.

The BuildUp and Maintenance approaches are based on the concept of “Feed the soil and Feed the crop” where fertilizers are applied over the selected time period until nutrient levels are raised to the critical soil test levels, then applications are continued at a rate to maintain the nutrient levels to sustain that soil test. The common approach of fertilizer adjustments based on Soil test rating equates general or blanket recommendation to medium fertility status of soil available NPK. For soils testing low or high category, the fertilizer recommendations are increased or decreased by 30 per cent of the general recommendations. Nutrient recommendations through postharvest soil test values prediction equations have much practical significance. The relevance and value of soil testing increases through yield targeting based fertilizer recommendations. Futuristic approaches like precision agriculture, use of GIS, GPS and RS, Cloud computing, and Big data are versatile components of plant nutrients / fertilizer recommendation. In these approaches, variability of conditions in each field is accounted for and fertilizer recommendation is made precisely so as to optimize the use of soil resources, increase yield, reduce production costs, minimize negative impacts to the environment and ensure optimum returns from its investment.

Timely monitoring of flood extent helps authorities identify severe impacts and plan relief operations. Remote sensing through satellite imagery is an effective method to identify flooded areas. However, critical contextual information about the severity of structural damage or urgent needs of affected population cannot be obtained from remote sensing alone. On the other hand, social sensing through microblogging sites can potentially provide useful information directly from eyewitnesses and affected people. Therefore, this paper explores the integration of remote sensing and social sensing data to derive informed flood extent maps. For this purpose, we employ state-of-the-art deep learning methods to process heterogeneous data obtained from four case-study areas, including two urban regions from Somalia and India and two coastal regions from Italy and The Bahamas. On the remote sensing side, we observe that deep learning models perform generally better than Otsu in flood water prediction. For example, for highly urban areas from Somalia and India, U-Net achieves better F1-scores (0.471 and 0.310, respectively) than Otsu (0.297 and 0.251, respectively). Similarly, for coastal areas, FCN yields a better F1-score for Italy (0.128) than Otsu (0.083) while FCN and Otsu perform on par for The Bahamas (0.102 and 0.105, respectively). Then, on the social sensing side, we add two data layers representing relevant tweet text and images posted from the case-study regions to highlight different ways these heterogeneous data sources complement each other. Our extensive analyses reveal several valuable insights. In particular, we identify three types of signals: (i) confirmatory signals from both sources, which puts greater confidence that a specific region is flooded, (ii) complementary signals that provide different contextual information including needs and requests, disaster impact or damage reports and situational information, and (iii) novel signals when both data sources do not overlap and provide unique information. © 2022 The Authors","Deep learning; Flood mapping; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122793892

Yet the farmer’s won’t get enough money. It is mostly due to insufficient irrigation or crop quality, or crop yield is less than expected at times. Use temperature, soil, moisture, ph sensor, we can evaluate the land and we can estimate how much yield we get. This forecast will help farmers select appropriate crops by soil type, temperature, humidity, soil pH, season, fertilizer and months. This prediction can be accomplished by means of the support-vector machine learning algorithm. World population is growing, and adequate production of crops is required. Monitoring crop growth and predicting yields is highly important to the economic development of a country. The estimation of crop yields has a direct impact on national and international economies, and plays a significant role in food health and food safety. Deep learning is gaining popularity in crop control, crop type recognition, and crop yield estimation applications with recent advances in image recognition using deep Convolutionary Neural Networks. Current crop yield prediction approaches focused on remote sensing are composed of classical machine learning methods such as supporting vector machines and decision trees. Because India is an agricultural country and is primarily dependent on agriculture and agro-industrial products development in its economy. New research into the study of crop yields is Data Mining.

For this, a combination of numerical techniques like Limit Equilibrium Method (LEM) and Finite Element Method (FEM) are utilized to inversely compute the engineering properties by validating the observed field data which is often the slope displacements recorded over a period of time. This approach is suitable for realistic stability assessment, reliable prediction and competent engineering design of landslide control measures. The present case study area is located near the Tehri Dam in Tehri Garhwal District of the Uttarakhand State, India. The landslide, known as the 12.55 km slide, is situated on the right bank of Bhagirathi River, approximately 13 km away from Tehri Dam in the river downstream. The stability of this slide is important since it often blocks the connecting road between Tehri Dam and Koteshwar Dam. This road is vital for the dam operation as well as for the locality. Hence, stability assessment and long-term monitoring of this slope is significantly important. For this, at first, a typical cross section parallel to the main sliding direction is selected and profiled for the stability assessment. This prevailing slope is then analysed using probabilistic limit equilibrium method. The shear strength properties of the slope debris materials were adopted as the random variables following normal distribution for determining its probabilistic factor of safety. After it, the mobilized shear strength parameters are back-analysed for a target safety factor of 1.0 (i.e. the critically stable slope condition). Since the landslide is reported to be moving slowly along the controlling shearing plane, the shear strength of the slip surface has either come close to or reached its long-term strength. It is then followed by a finite element stress analysis of the slope based on Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion for the debris and rock mass materials. From this analysis, slope displacements at the road level are documented and the elastic parameters (i.e. elastic modulus and Poisson’s ratio) are back-calculated to validate the observed slope displacements at road level from remote sensing interpretation over the years. In this way, a parametric analysis has been performed by varying both the elastic parameters and validating the road level displacements for recent past years. Once, the elastic parameters are validated based on actual slope displacements, the corresponding mobilized shear strength parameters are also revised for the study duration. Finally, these new set of shear strength parameters were utilized to obtain the global safety level of the slope as well as the year wise road displacements. The present study prepares a base work for a calibrated long-term monitoring of the slope displacements and will be useful for slope strengthening measure designs. © 2021, Indian Geotechnical Society.","Back-analysis; Finite element; Limit equilibrium; Probabilistic methods; Remote sensing; Slope displacement","Dams; Debris; Elasticity; Landslides; Normal distribution; Numerical methods; Remote sensing; Roads and streets; Safety factor; Shear strength; Stress analysis; System stability; Coulomb yield criteria; Engineering properties; Finite element stress analysis; Limit equilibrium methods; Mechanical parameters; Probabilistic factors; Remote sensing interpretation; Shear strength parameters; Finite element method; back analysis; Coulomb criterion; debris flow; displacement; finite element method; landslide; Mohr theory; numerical method; probability; remote sensing; shear strength; slope dynamics; slope stability; slope stabilization; India; Tehri Dam; Uttarakhand; Uttarakhand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107726505

The farmers need to have prior knowledge regarding expected crop yield and crop condition in their specific area to make their financial and agricultural decisions accordingly. In the past any kind of agricultural assessment was based on manual survey and data collection, but this outdated approach has been made more precise with easy access to Remote Sensing Data. Remote Sensing has made distinguishing land cover and vegetation much easier with the assistance of Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI).

The current study investigates the severity of land cover changes including deforestation activities in the Coonoor watershed region as a result of urbanization, along with the establishment of recreational parks, resorts and tea plantations. In order to analyse the changes, a widely used soil erosion model say Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is opted to estimate the average soil loss. Therefore, this work marks the impact of land-use changes on land degradation and the consequent vital natural phenomenon like soil erosion. The change detection was carried out for over 14 years period from 2005 to 2018. Landsat images of corresponding years were classified using the supervised classification technique. The C-factor (cover and management factor) for the corresponding periods were also identified. Conversion of forest land into tea plantations, wastelands and settlements significantly decrease the soil organic matter (SOM) and hydraulic conductivity (HC) of the soil, which leads to a difference in the K-factor (soil erodibility factor) throughout the study period, whereas the R-factor (rainfall and runoff factor) and LS-factor (length-slope factor) were considered to be constant throughout the period. Results indicate the annual soil loss during the period from 2000 to 2018 on each land use/cover classes. viz., tea plantations, 223.26 km2; settlement, 163.35 km2; open forest, 799.02 km2; dense forest, 1158.48 km2; and barren land, 27.18 km2. The total sediment yield in the study area was found to have oddly increased due to the land use/cover changes.

The seven standard parameters were suggested in the literature for the assessment of soil erosion hazard, viz. soil loss, sediment yield, run-off potential, land capability class, drainage density, sediment transport index, and slope. In the present study, the combination of intelligent vulnerability prediction, multi-criteria decision-making, and geographic information system techniques provides an effective approach to identify the soil erosion hazard in the semi-arid and humid region. It makes this process more effective and efficient as the vulnerability of soil erosion hazard can be predicted by the proposed trained models for any locations that have the streamlined values of above seven parameters as suggested in this paper. The standard machine learning classifiers such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, random forest (RF), multinomial naive bays, adaptive boosting, and gradient adaptive boosting (GAB) have been applied on the spatial data set of “Pairi” river watershed found in “Chhattisgarh”, India. There are five categories of soil abrasion, viz. “very low”, “low”, “medium”, “high”, and “very high”, in this data set that represents an index of soil erosion hazard.

We aim to help farmers in choosing the right crops to grow, by providing them with prospective results that they can look to achieve if they do invest in those crops on their farmland.

In this study, both optical (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel-1A) satellite datasets were used for predicting paddy yield at a spatial scale in conjunction with Crop Cutting Experiment (CCE) data in Sahibganj district of the Jharkhand state (India) during the monsoon season 2017. The yield prediction models were developed from linear (LR) and multiple regression (MR) analysis. The AquaCrop model was also employed to simulate the paddy yield. The key findings showed that the MR-based yield model developed from SAR (Vertical transmission and Vertical reception (VV) + Vertical transmission and Horizontal reception (VH) polarizations) data was more accurate, reasonable, and reliable as compared to the optical-based (NDVI + EVI) MR yield model. The SAR-based MR yield model showed better accuracy between predicted and observed yield (CCE) as evaluated using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE = 0.68). However, the optical-based MR yield model showed relatively lower accuracy (NSE = 0.62). The relative deviation (RD) of the predicted yield from the SAR and optical-based MR model was nearly 3% and 4%, respectively. Using the AquaCrop model, the simulated yield was underestimated by approximately 4%. We conclude that the SAR-based MR-yield model outperformed the optical-based model to predict paddy yield at a spatial scale, and the adopted methodology can beneficial for decision-makers withing agriculture monitoring.

We compared four linear and non-linear regression models: multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine for regression (SVR) and gradient boosting (GB) for estimation of NPK and OC.

In the present study, the impact of landuse change (2006–2016) on runoff and sediment yield has been assessed in Patiala-Ki-Rao watershed (5140 ha) located in Shivalik foot-hills, using remote sensing, geographical information system (GIS), and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) watershed model. The watershed has seven major landuse classes, namely agriculture, built-up, fallow land, forest, grass land, streams, and water bodies. The landuse change analysis indicated that the area under all the landuses decreased except built-up that increased by 372.27 ha (112.04%). Forest is the most affected landuse among all watershed landuses that shrinked by 194.90 ha followed by agriculture (64.57 ha), grass land (50.81 ha), streams (30.42 ha), fallow land (21.86 ha), and water bodies (9.72 ha). Runoff and sediment yield for the landuse of the years 2006 and 2016 were simulated by the WEPP model using two climate scenarios (2006 and 2016). The simulated runoff, sediment yield, and sediment delivery ratio increased by 18.62%, 48.04%, and 32.23% under Climate-2006 and 26.78%, 30.23%, and 16.09% under Climate-2016 due to change in landuse during a period of 10 years.

We studied the feasibility of using reflectance spectra from a handheld radiometer and a camera on board a drone at 80 m above the crop to assess physiological changes, differential responses of crop to nutrient managements (N, P, and NPK) and also predicted the likely losses of grain yield caused by one night's frost damage in 90-day-old maize crop in Meghalaya, northeast India. A portable single-beam field spectroradiometer (model SVC-HR-1024) was used to measure radiation in the range of 350 to 2500 nm with varying bandwidth at 1 m above the crop. All measurements (both before and after frost) were made strictly between 11:00 and 13:00 h, when the sun was almost overhead. Similarly, a Parrot Sequoia multispectral camera sensing in four wavebands was mounted underneath a drone (DJI Matrix 600 model). We compared the measured spectra with those recorded on the same crop before the frost and also measured several biochemical constituents in the leaves on the two occasions for comparison. The frost damage increased the reflectance in the photosynthetically active visible and infrared regions with a strong peak at 2100 nm while it caused a sharp decline in the near-infrared (between 720 and 1350 nm) and shift in the red edge. It caused a decrease in the normalized difference vegetation index as measured by the radiometer from an average of 0.36 to 0.13 and a decrease from 0.5 to 0.31 as measured from the drone. The yield in frosted year was on average 870 kg ha - 1 less than in the previous frost-free year on the same plots. Frost injury reduced leaf pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids), nitrogen, and grain yield by a greater magnitude in P-stressed and NPK-deficient maize crops over N-stressed and stress-free (with NPK) plants. Spectral reflectance and vegetation indices also varied significantly. We could also assess quantitatively the crop's loss of photosynthetic potential from the hyperspectral reflectance measurements and from the low-flying drone. The latter technology should enable farmers to monitor and assess frost damage immediately and to predict the likely losses of yield. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","drone; frost damage; maize; northeast India; spectral radiometry; yield prediction","Cameras; Crops; Drones; Infrared devices; Physiological models; Radiometers; Reflection; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Frost damage; maize; Northeast india; Spectral radiometry; Yield prediction; Damage detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077782588

Here, we performed a comprehensive study on utilization of multi-temporal satellite data (i.e., Landsat-8 and MODIS) for wheat acreage and yield estimation during winter season (2016–2017) over the Sahibganj District in Jharkhand (India). Phenological variables were derived using the time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which helps to understand the phenological transitions of wheat. The NDVI profile was used to derive rules for decision tree classifier to map the acerage of wheat. The key findings indicate that the acerage of wheat was estimated as ~3870 ha. Further, the long-term wheat statistics data were used to derive a yield model. Based on this model, wheat production was predicted as ~4523 t for the winter season 2016–2017, while, the mean was 3482 t. Predicted wheat yield was as ~1.17 t/ha, which was underestimated by 0.07 t/ha. Thus, it can be concluded that the accuracy of yield prediction depends on the precision of wheat acerage map derived from remote sensing data. A significant challenge for accurate acerage mapping could be the coarser spatial resolution of satellite data as the average plot sizes of Indian farmers can be far smaller than pixel sizes of the satellite data. Nevertheless, this comprehensive case study inferred that satellite-derived wheat acerage can be preferred to predict yield instead of traditional-based survey estimates. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Decision tree; Phenology; Remote sensing; Wheat acerage; Yield prediction","crop production; crop yield; Landsat; mapping method; NDVI; phenology; pixel; precision; prediction; satellite data; spatial resolution; wheat; India; Jharkhand; Sahibganj; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079394487

Mapping the spatial distribution of paddy and predicting yields are crucial for food security measures. Over the last three decades, remote sensing techniques have been widely used for monitoring and management of agricultural systems. This study has employed Sentinel-based both optical (Sentinel-2B) and SAR (Sentinel-1A) sensors data for paddy acreage mapping in Sahibganj district, Jharkhand during the monsoon season in 2017. A robust machine learning Random Forest (RF) classification technique was deployed for the paddy acreage mapping. A simple linear regression yield model was developed for predicting yields. The key findings showed that the paddy acreage was about 68.3–77.8 thousand hectares based on Sentinel-1A and 2B satellite data, respectively. Accordingly, the paddy production of the district was estimated as 108–126 thousand tonnes. The paddy yield was predicted as 1.60 tonnes/hectare. The spatial distribution of paddy based on RF classifier and accuracy assessment of LULC maps revealed that the SAR-based classified paddy map was more consistent than the optical data. Nevertheless, this comprehensive study concluded that the SAR data could be more pronounced in acreage mapping and yield estimation for providing timely information to decision makers. © 2019, Korean Spatial Information Society.","Acreage mapping; Random Forest classifier; SAR data; Yield estimation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071135208

The Ku-band with a frequency of 13.515 GHz has the ability to interact with the surface layer and hence is useful for providing information on top portion of canopy and hence the grain and awns of rice crop. Also it has the capability to generate information over the whole region of South Asia in one day. Hence the present study was carried out to explore the super resolved Ku band back scattering coefficient from space borne scatterometer (SCATSAT-1) for rice productivity assessment over six Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka). The super resolved sigma-0 in both polarization (H and V) for the kharif rice season of 2017 (May to Mid-Nov) was used for this study. The temporal backscatter was used to generate rice planting date using polynomial fitting. Multiple regression models were developed using the daily SH/SV ratio and the farm-level fresh paddy yield collected through the Crop Cutting Experiment (CCE). The validation of the model was done for India at state level. For other countries national average reported yield was compared with the estimated yield. The rice planting date was found to vary from first week of June to last week of August in different parts of the six countries. Country average yield was found to vary from 3.45 t ha-1 in Sri Lanka to 4.32 t ha-1 in Myanmar. The absolute difference was lowest in India (8 %) followed by Sri Lanka (-11 %) and maximum in Nepal (35 %). In Indian states, the validation results showed a correlation coefficient of 0.95 at state level with a RMSE of 0.28 tha-1 (11.4% of mean reported yield). This study showed the possibility of using high frequency and high resolution Ku-band back scattering coefficient for rice grain yield estimation at continental scale such as Asia. The yield estimation can be further improved with the use of country-wise crop cutting data for model development and validation. © Authors 2019.

Rice is an important staple food and provides nutritious need for the billions of population. Mapping the spatial distribution of paddy and predicting yields at district level aggregation are crucial for food security measures. This study has utilized the time-series MODIS-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data in conjunction with CCE data to derive a statistical model for up-scaling paddy yield at satellite-footprint scale over Sahibganj district in Kharif (monsoon) season 2017. The CCE data were collected from ten random paddy plots. In addition, Area, Production, and Yield (APY) data were collected during harvesting period by interacting with eighty farmers belong to eight villages. The AquaCrop model was also used to simulate the paddy yield for Kharif season. The key results showed that based on the farmers-based yield data, paddy yield was observed as ~3200 kg/hectare, whereas, NDVI and EVI-based yield models based on satellite data showed about 2,960 and 3,530 kg/hectare, respectively. Moreover, multi-regression-based yield model showed the mean yield of 3,070 kg/hectare. With respect to farmers-level yield data, the relative deviation (RD) of yield based on NDVI data was -7.5% (underestimation), while EVI was 10.31% (overestimation). The multi-regression-based yield model and AquaCrop model were underestimated by -4.06 and - 10.16%, respectively. Thus, it can be inferred that the multi-regression-based yield was close to farmers-based survey yields. It can be concluded that the satellite databased yield prediction can be reliable with ±10% of RD. Nevertheless, remote sensing technology can be beneficial over traditional survey method as the satellite-based methods are cost-effective, robust, reliable, and time-saving than the traditional methods. © Authors 2019.

The basin experiences seasonal water stress conditions with a scarcity of surface water. In the presented study, delineation of groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) is carried out using a geospatial multi-influencing factor technique. Geology, geomorphology, soil type, land use/land cover, rainfall, lineament and fault density, drainage density, slope, and elevation of the study area were considered for the delineation of GWPZs in the study area. About 9.3, 71.9 and 18.8% of the study area falls within good, moderate and poor groundwater potential zones, respectively. The potential groundwater yield data corroborate the outcome of the model, with maximum yield in the older floodplain and minimum yield in the hard-rock terrains in the western and south-western regions.

As in situ observations of soil moisture are few or not available, researchers use data derived from remote sensing satellites or global reanalysis. This study documents the intercomparison of soil moisture from remotely sensed and reanalyses during dry spells within monsoon seasons in central India and central Myanmar. Soil moisture data from the European Space Agency (ESA)—Climate Change Initiative (CCI) has been treated as observed data and was compared against soil moisture data from the ECMWF reanalysis-Interim (ERA-I) and the climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) for the period of 2002–2011. The ESA soil moisture correlates rather well with observed gridded rainfall. The ESA data indicates that soil moisture increases over India from west to east and from north to south during monsoon season. The ERA-I overestimates the soil moisture over India, while the CFSR soil moisture agrees well with the remotely sensed observation (ESA). Over Myanmar, both the reanalysis overestimate soil moisture values and the ERA-I soil moisture does not show much variability from year to year. Day-to-day variations of soil moisture in central India and central Myanmar during weak monsoon conditions indicate that, because of the rainfall deficiency, the observed (ESA) and the CFSR soil moisture values are reduced up to 0.1 m3/m3 compared to climatological values of more than 0.35 m3/m3. This reduction is not seen in the ERA-I data. Therefore, soil moisture from the CFSR is closer to the ESA observed soil moisture than that from the ERA-I during weak phases of monsoon in the study region. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",,"climate prediction; climatology; data set; monsoon; rainfall; remote sensing; soil moisture; summer; India; Myanmar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962239658

Nevertheless, it has been difficult to characterize the production of individual smallholder farms, given that the land-holding size in most areas of South Asia (&lt;2 ha) is smaller than the spatial resolution of most freely available satellite imagery, like Landsat and MODIS. In addition, existing methods to map yield require field-level data to develop and parameterize predictive algorithms that translate satellite vegetation indices to yield, yet these data are costly or difficult to obtain in many smallholder systems. To overcome these challenges, this study explores two issues. First, we employ new high spatial (2 m) and temporal (bi-weekly) resolution micro-satellite SkySat data to map sowing dates and yields of smallholder wheat fields in Bihar, India in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growing seasons. Second, we compare how well we predict sowing date and yield when using ground data, like crop cuts and self-reports, versus using crop models, which require no on-the-ground data, to develop and parameterize prediction models. Overall, sow dates were predicted well (R2 = 0.41 in 2014-2015 and R2 = 0.62 in 2015-2016), particularly when using models that were parameterized using self-report sow dates collected close to the time of planting and when using imagery that spanned the entire growing season. We were also able to map yields fairly well (R2 = 0.27 in 2014-2015 and R2 = 0.33 in 2015-2016), with crop cut parameterized models resulting in the highest accuracies. While less accurate, we were able to capture the large range in sow dates and yields across farms when using models parameterized with crop model data and these estimates were able to detect known relationships between management factors (e.g., sow date, fertilizer, and irrigation) and yield. While these results are specific to our study site in India, it is likely that the methods employed and the lessons learned are applicable to smallholder systems more generally across the globe. This is of particular interest given that similar high spatio-temporal resolution micro-satellite data will become increasingly available in the coming years. © 2016 by the authors.","Agriculture; High-resolution satellite imagery; SkySat; Smallholder farms; Terra Bella; Yields","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; DNA sequences; Forestry; Parameter estimation; Parameterization; Remote sensing; Satellites; Vegetation; High resolution satellite imagery; Parameterized model; Predictive algorithms; Satellite vegetation; SkySat; Spatio-temporal resolution; Terra Bella; Yields; Satellite imagery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019712461

Among the factors contributing towards this yield gap are the biotic stresses that affect the crops growth and development. Severity of infestation of the pests and diseases differs between agroclimatic region, individual crops and seasons within a region. Information about the timing of start of infestation of these diseases and pests with their gradual progress in advance could enable plan necessary pesticide schedule for the season, region on the particular crop against the specific menace expected. This could be enabled by development of region, crop and pest-specific prediction models to forewarn these menaces. In India most (70%) of the land-holding size of farmers average 0.39 ha (some even 20 m x 20 m) and only 1% crop growers hold< 10 ha (mean: 17.3 ha). Patchiness of disease and pest incidence could pose problems in its proper assessment and management. Thus, such exercise could be highly time-consuming and labour-intensive for the seventh largest country with difficult terrain, 66% gross cropped area under food crops, lacking in number of skilled manpower and shrinking resources. Remote sensing overcomes such limitations with ability to access all parts of the country and can often achieve a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution and thus leading to an accurate estimation of area affected. Due to pest and disease stress plants showed different behavior in terms of physiological and morphological changes lead to symptoms such as wilting, curling of leaf, stunned growth, reduction in leaf area due to severe defoliation or chlorosis or necrosis of photosynthetically active parts (Prabhakar et al., 2011; Booteet al., 1983; Aggarwal et al., 2006). Damage evaluation of diseases has been largely done by visual inspections and quantification but visual quantification of plant pest and diseases with accuracy and precision is a tough task. Utilization of remote sensing techniques are based on the assumption that plant pest and disease stresses interfere with physical structure and function of plant and influence the absorption of light energy and therefore changes the reflectance spectrum of plants. Moreover, remote sensing provides better means to objectively quantify crop stress than visual methods and it can be used repeatedly to collect sample measurements non-destructively and non-invasively (Nutteret et al., 1990; Nilson, 1995).

The present study describes the evaluation of sedimentation carried out for Vaigai reservoir situated in Tamil Nadu, India. Vaigai reservoir nourishes the inhabitants through water storage and supply for irrigation and water power. Nowadays, capacity loss occurs in the reservoir due to sedimentation. As it is highly tedious and uneconomical to do hydrographic surveys, the frequentness in finding the sediment yield becomes impossible. But the recent application of remote sensing and GIS technologies in the field of Civil Engineering make it possible. The Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) method for prediction of reservoir sedimentation uses directly the water-spread area of the reservoir at a particular elevation on the date of pass of the satellite. With known area and the difference in level of water, the capacity and thereby the loss in capacity of the reservoir due to sedimentation can also be estimated.

Soil detachment by rain and river that takes place in hilly areas causes severe landslides and floods resulting in high sedimentation in the reservoir. Hence, a quantitative assessment of soil erosion is needed so that good management approaches can be developed. Four basic factors influence soil erosion by water viz., climate, soil properties, topography and land use practices. The aim of this paper is to test the applicability of a distributed model, Areal Non Point Source Watershed Environmental Response Simulation (ANSWERS), designed for catchments predominant with agriculture land to a catchment with thick vegetation cover and steep slopes. Kumaradhara catchment in Karnataka state with dense forest and elevation was considered for the study. Soil erosivity factors were considered as input for the model in GIS environment. The model was tested for five rainfall events in the year 2011 and four in the year 2012. The estimated sediment yield from the distributed approach has been compared with the observed values. The value of coefficient of determination was also obtained, indicating the prediction from ANSWERS model for the catchment is good. A map depicting the spatial distribution of soil erosion in the catchment has also been prepared which helps in visualizing the regions affected by severe erosion. High erosion was observed near stream bed, although the overall sediment yield estimated is less. This may be due to vegetation cover, particularly forest cover in most part of the catchment. However, more studies are required on the applicability of ANSWERS model in catchments predominately covered with forest. © 2016 CAFET-INNOVA TECHNICAL SOCIETY.

It is an important data mining strategy for modeling the temporal dynamics of these parameters and forecasting them in future time instances. The meteorological parameters, measured near the earth surface, are eminently influenced by the surrounding land-cover distribution of the terrain. For the time-series prediction of these parameters, the knowledge of spatial land-covers can be contemplated within the space-time trade-off between the sample points. This work presents a new kriging based spatio-temporal interpolation method, namely times-series semantic kriging (SemKts) which deals with land-cover dynamics and incorporates this knowledge for better prediction accuracy. It is a time-series extension of our earlier work on semantic kriging (SemK) for spatial interpolation [1] [2]. Experimentation has been carried out by considering real land surface temperature data in the spatial region Kolkata, India.

Remote sensing-based NDVI also plays a key role in drought assessment, but alone it fails due to time lag of 3–4 weeks. In view of improving drought monitoring in Bundelkhand region of India, it was proposed to use combination of meteorological and remote sensing-based approach. The study aims to monitor and assess inter-annual variability in spatial drought and related crop loss in Bundelkhand region using time series of daily rainfall of Climate Prediction Centre (NOAA) and SPOT-VGT-based normalized difference vegetation index. Instead of NDVI, vegetation condition index (VCI) was used to normalize geographical differences in vegetation types and physiographical setting. The new approach is linear weighted index called spatial vegetation drought index (SVDI) constructed from VCI derived from SPOT-VGT and meteorological index named rainfall anomaly index (RAI) for monitoring short-term drought stress in Bundelkhand region. The spatial and temporal pattern of drought matches well with RAI. VCI found to be significantly related to drought stress in terms of rainfall anomaly for majority of decades as well as crop yield anomaly of both food grains and pulses. A modified rainfall anomaly (MRAI) was also constructed by assigning weights to RAI of past three decades to normalize the residual moisture status. The newly formulated SVDI obtained by integrating MRAI and VCI improved the spatial prediction of drought and to detect crop loss associated with short-term drought stress. Comparing real-time drought condition from the observation around the concerned area showed that SVDI was able to illustrate drought stress on large-scale efficiently and can give information about the departure in crop productivity when correlated with crop yield anomaly. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Crop yield anomaly; Drought; SPOT-VGT; SVDI; VCI",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939983297

It allows accounting for spatial and temporal variations of state and driving variables, influencing crop growth and development, without extensive ground surveys. The crop phenological development and condition can be monitored through multi-temporal reflectance profiles or multi-temporal vegetation indices (VI), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). At the same time, Process based dynamic crop growth simulation models are useful tools for estimating crop growth condition and yield on large spatial domains if their parameters and initial conditions are known for each point. Therefore, combined approaches integrating remote sensing and dynamic crop growth models for regional yield prediction have been developed in several studies. In these models the vegetation state variables, e.g., development phase, dry mass, LAI are linked to driving variables, e.g., weather condition, nutrient availability and management practices. Output of these models is usually final yield or accumulated biomass. The model outputs are a summary containing an overview of the main development events, water and nitrogen variables, yield and yield components. In the present work, IRS P6 AWiFS derived vegetation indices like NDVI and NDWI are computed to study the growth profile of wheat crop in Sirsa district of Haryana along with crop growth simulation model DSSAT-CERES from 2008-09 to 2012-13.several iteration of wheat crop simulation are carried out with four sowing dates and four soil types varying with respect to the fertility parameters to represent the average simulation environment of Sirsa district in Haryana state of India. Four years time series NDVI and NDWI are used to establish the correlation between the spectral vegetation indices and simulated wheat yield attributes at critical growth stages of wheat.

DREAM takes account of watershed heterogeneity as reflected by land use, soil type, topography and rainfall, measured in the field or estimated through remote sensing, and generates estimates of runoff and sediment yield in spatial and temporal domains. The model is based on simultaneous solution of flow dynamics, based on kinematic wave theory, followed by solution of soil erosion dynamics. As the storm rainfall proceeds, the process of overland flow generation is dependent on the interception storage and infiltration rates. The components of the soil erosion model have been modified to provide better prediction of sediment flow rates and sediment yields. The validation study conducted to test the performance of the model in simulating soil erosion and sediment yield during different storm events monitored in the study watershed showed that the model outputs are satisfactory. Details of a sensitivity analysis, model calibration and the statistical evaluation of the results obtained are also presented and discussed.

Salinization due to sea water ingress causes impact on water resources especially in coastal areas. Thus there is scarcity of fresh water in this region. Climate change causes rise in sea level and this leads to increase of salinity in coastal lakes. Satellite imagery analysis now plays a prominent role in the quick assessment of water quality in a vast area. This study is an attempt to assess the extent of a lake system affected by sea water (Akkulam-Veli lake, Kerala, India) using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite, IRS P6 LISS III imagery. Field data were collected on the date of the satellite overpass. Simple regression equation using radiance in red band is found to yield superior results for the prediction of sodium content whereas polynomial equation using radiance of red band is found to yield superior results for the prediction of chloride content than the simple and multiple regression equations using spectral ratios and radiance from the individual bands from satellite imagery. The refractive index of water containing sodium chloride is more when compared with that of fresh water and this in turn results in high reflection of visible light in the red band when compared to blue and green bands. Hence the radiance of red band gives direct measure of sodium and chloride in lake water.

Arbitrary selection of cell size for these models yields ambiguous results. Automatic extraction of watershed drainage characteristics from digital elevation model (DEM) is an effective alternative to the tedious manual mapping from topographic maps. Geographical information systems(GIS), DEM and remote sensing techniques provide faster, more efficient and accurate ways to extract parameters of distributed parameter models for each cell. In India, very limited applications of these advanced techniques have been made in NPS pollution modelling. The present aims to study the effect of cell size variation on hydrological simulations of the distributed parameter Agricultural Non Point Source (AGNPS) pollution model version 5.00 for a 16.13 km2 small watershed of the eastern India using DEM, GIS and remote sensing techniques for automatic extraction of the model input parameters. Land use and land cover information generated from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1B,LISS-II) data resulted in overall classification accuracy greater than 88%. Important watershed parameters such as drainage area, stream network, slope etc. were extracted most accurately automatically with variations less than 10% using DEM of 30 m resolution through EASI/PACE and IDRISI GIS software. The extracted watershed drainage area, the main channel and drainage network from 30 m resolution DEM closely matched (with variations less than 2%) with the watershed area and drainage network delineated manually from 1:25000 scale topographical maps. The cell size variation from 30 m to 150 m influences the accuracy of watershed parameters extracted from DEM such as drainage network, flow path length, field and channel slope. The flow path length and average watershed slope decrease by 53.71% and 20.94% respectively for the increase in cell size from 30 m to 150 m. The runoff, peak flow and sediment yield data from 15 rainfall-runoff events of 1995 and 1996 are used for the AGNPS model cell size sensitivity study. The model simulations are evaluated using standard statistics such as per cent deviation, coefficient of efficiency, Student's t tests etc. Runoff and peak flow simulations were not affected for the increase in cell size from 60 m to 150 m. Cell size is found to be the most important factor affecting sediment yield simulations which decrease as cell size increases. Statistical tests indicate that the sediment yield predictions are within the acceptable level and not significantly different from the observed values for the cell size upto 120 m. The deviations are significantly higher than the observed values for larger cell size.","AGNPS; Cell size; DEM; GIS; Remote sensing; Sediment yield; Watershed","AGNPS; Cell size; Coefficient of efficiencies; DEM; Distributed-parameter model; Indian remote sensing satellite; Non-point source pollution; Sediment yields; Cells; Computer simulation; Computer software; Cytology; Drainage; Extraction; Geographic information systems; Landforms; Maps; Remote sensing; Runoff; Sedimentology; Sediments; Statistical tests; Water quality; Watersheds; Water pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878261530

The study suggests that SPOT-VGT/NDVI and SPOT-VGT/EVI with the spatial resolution of 1 km can both be used for operational global crop growth monitoring and yield prediction. The method for yield trend prediction can give the accuracy as high as 100%. In the most luxuriant period SPOT-VGT/EVI can give more exact information of crop growth condition than SPOT-VGT/NDVI.","Crop; EVI; Growth condition; Monitoring; NDVI; Remote sensing; Yield prediction","Crop growth; Crop growth condition; EVI; Global scale; Ground observations; Growth conditions; Meteorological models; NDVI; Remote sensing models; Spatial resolution; Yield prediction; Yield trends; Condition monitoring; Crops; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865353132

It carries the highest amount of sediment compared to other catchment in India. This catchment spreading an area of 41,285 square km is drained by river Indravati, which is one of the northern tributaries of the river Godavari in its lower reach. In the present study, USLE is used to estimate sediment yield at the outlet of river Indravati catchment. Both magnitude and spatial distribution of potential soil erosion in the catchment is determined. From the model output predictions, it is found that average erosion rate predicted is 18.00 tons/ha/year and sediment yield at the out let of the catchment is 22.31 Million tons per year. The predicted sediment yield verified with the observed data. The Indravathi basin is divided into 424 sub-watersheds and prioritization of all 424 sub-watersheds is carried out according to soil loss intensity for soil conservation purpose. Generated soil loss map will be useful to soil conservationist and decision makers for watershed management. Overall 19.71 % of the area is undergoing high erosion rates which are a major contributor to the sediment yield (78.04 %) in the catchment. This area represents high-priority area for management in order to reduce soil losses, which are mostly found in upstream of the catchment. It is indicated that the areas of high soil erosion can be accounted for in terms of steep unstable terrain, and the occurrence of highly erodible soils and low vegetation cover.","GIS; Remote sensing; Sediment yield; Soil Erosion; USLE","Catchments; Decision making; Erosion; Geographic information systems; Photogrammetry; Rivers; Runoff; Sediments; Soil conservation; Soils; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Decision makers; Prioritization; Remote sensing and GIS; Sediment yields; Soil erosion; USLE; Vegetation cover; Watershed management; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924225272

Lakes are versatile ecosystems and their eutrophication is a serious problem. Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI) provides an insight into the trophic condition of a lake. CTSI has been modified for the study area and is used in this study. Satellite imagery analysis now plays a prominent role in the quick assessment of water quality in a vast area. This study is an attempt to assess the trophic state index based on secchi disk depth and chlorophyll a of a lake system (Akkulam-Veli lake, Kerala, India) using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) P6 LISS III imagery. Field data were collected on the date of the overpass of the satellite. Multiple regression equation is found to yield superior results than the simple regression equations using spectral ratios and radiance from the individual bands, for the prediction of trophic state index from satellite imagery. The trophic state index based on secchi disk depth, derived from the satellite imagery, provides an accurate prediction of the trophic status of the lake.

The model parameters were calibrated using measured data on runoff volumes and sediment yield. The calibrated model was validated by producing the monthly runoff and sediment yield simulations and comparing them with data that were not used in calibration. The model was also used to make surface runoff and sediment yield simulations for each of the individual watershed elements, comprising 18 hillslopes and seven channels, and the detailed monthly results for each are presented.

This model is based on an indigenous crop growth simulator called Infocrop. The Infocrop-cotton model was calibrated and validated to simulate the effect of diverse weather, soil, and agronomic management practices on growth, development and yield of cotton varieties and hybrids using results of several diverse field experiments (60 datasets). These experiments were conducted during 2000-01 to 2004-05 in major cotton-producing states of India across locations spreading from Hisar (29°10′N, 75°46′E) to Coimbatore (11°00′N, 77°00′E) with varying management practices, weather and soil. The model satisfactorily simulated the trends in leaf area, dry matter growth, days to flowering and seed cotton yield. The simulated time to flowering and maturity varied between 54 and 80 days as well as 136 to 193 days, with an RMSE value of 3 and 8.5 days respectively. Total biomass and seed cotton yield showed an accuracy of 86 and 89% respectively. The model also precisely simulated water deficit and N stress, the two important abiotic constraints for dryland cotton production. The Infocrop-cotton model was used in conjunction with RS and GIS techniques for developing an integrated approach for deriving cotton production estimates. Resourcesat-1 LISS III data of October/November months corresponding to peak vegetative stage of cotton crop were used to derive spatial distribution of cotton crop. The study area was classified as polythesian polygons based on pedo-climatic variables, namely soil type, soil depth and rainfall pattern using GIS. Cotton yields for each of these polygons were simulated using the crop model and were aggregated to determine the total production of the district. The prediction of cotton production was more accurate to the partially irrigated or irrigated districts and not for the rainfed districts. The utility of the integrated approach in prediction of cotton production at the regional level has been discussed.","Cotton; Crop simulation model; Production; Remote sensing","Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049150795

Sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out for the input parameters. The analysis shows that the sediment yield is highly sensitive to interrill erodibility and effective hydraulic conductivity, whereas, runoff is sensitive to effective hydraulic conductivity only. Initially, the model was calibrated using data from the 1996 monsoon season and subsequently its performance was evaluated by estimating the daily runoff and sediment yield using the monsoon season data of different years. Coefficient of determination (R2) (0.86-0.91), Nash-Sutcliffe simulation model efficiency (0.85-0.95), and percent deviation values (7.90-15.15) indicate accurate simulation of runoff from the watershed. Performance of the WEPP model for simulation of sediment yield was also evaluated. High value of coefficient of determination (R2) (0.81-0.95), Nash-Sutcliffe simulation model efficiency (0.78-0.92) and percent deviation values (4.43-19.30) for sediment yield indicate that the WEPP model can be successfully used in the upper Damodar Valley, India. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The potential of widely used vegetation indices like NDVI and SR (simple ratio) and the recently proposed TVI has been evaluated for the prediction of green leaf tea yield and made tea yield based on image-derived leaf area index (LAI), along with weather parameters. It was observed that the yield model based on the TVI showed the highest correlation (R2 = 0.83) with green leaf tea yield. The NDVI- and SR-based models suffered non-responsiveness when the yield approached maximum. The NDVI and SR showed saturation when the LAI exceeded a magnitude of 4. However, the TVI responded well, even when the LAI exceeded 5, and thus has potential use in the estimation of the LAI of dense vegetation such as some crops and forest where it generally exceeds the threshold value of 4. An attempt was made for the innovative application of TCT and NDWI in the mapping of waterlogging in tea plantation land. The NDWI in conjunction with TCT offered fairly good accuracy (87%) in the delineation of tea areas prone to waterlogging.

The study was carried out through field experiments conducted for six years (1994-1999) at Hayatnagar Research Farm, Hyderabad, India. In each year, four cultivars of castor beans, viz. VP-1, 48-1, GCH-4 and Aruna, were planted on two different dates maintaining an interval of 6-8 weeks so as to expose the crop to different environments. The infrared thermometric observations like canopy-air temperature differential (Tc-Ta) explained 50-60% variation in soil moisture status and showed a significant relationship with soil moisture. Yield of castor beans exhibited significant inverse relationship with Tc -Ta, which explained 59% of variation in yield. The hybrid GCH-4, registering comparatively lesser mean Tc-Ta over the entire growing period, established itself as a better cultivar. The spectrometer observations also proved GCH-4 to be a superior genotype in view of its higher reflectance in near-infrared region of the spectrum. The significant negative relationship of Tc Ta of GCH-4 with saturation vapour pressure deficit brought out its drought tolerance trait over the other genotypes studied.

Atmospheric normalisation of AVHRR data was performed prior to deriving district-level area weighted average NDVI (AWANDVI). The invariant growth profile model suggested by Badhwar was fitted and spectral emergence date, maximum vegetative vigour, peak day value of profile, growth rate and senescence rate, area under the curve, etc. were derived. These parameters were related to the reported district-level wheat yields using multiple regression analysis. A field study was also conducted using a handheld spectro-radiometer at the research station of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana. From this field experimental data, wheat growth profile parameters were derived which were compared with satellite based parameters. Inversion of the models was carried out to evaluate the results by comparing the reported and predicted wheat yields. The results indicate highly significant fitting of the NDVI profile to the Badhwar model as indicated by multiple linear correlation coefficients and Fisher test. A significant relationship between district-level wheat yields and fractional area under the curve was also observed. The overall correlation of 0.82 for Punjab and Haryana states was obtained between reported yield and growth profile derived parameters. Atmospheric normalisation resulted in improvement of prediction model statistics (R increased from 0.42 to 0.86).

A poor relationship between leaf area and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (r=0.17) and IR/R (r=0.11) was observed in ICCV-88202 and ICCC-37 varieties 66 days after sowing (DAS). The hypothesis that short-duration varieties should show a significant positive correlation (due to these crops attaining high biomass at an early growth stage) did not hold good. Contrary to this, in ICCV-10 (a medium maturing variety) the leaf area showed a poor relation with NDVI (r=0.39) and IR/R (r=0.45) at 84 DAS. As varieties ICCV-88202 (V2) and ICCC-37 (V3) in soil types S1 and S2 are high in biomass at 66 DAS (as is evident from the high values of leaf area) the possible reason for such a poor relationship is masking the effect due to profuse violet and pink flowers at the top of the plant canopy. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicate that the influences due to soils and varieties yield a significant difference in IR/R ratio but a non-significant difference in NDVI both at 66 and 84 DAS. In gram with indeterminate growth habit, the biophysical parameters showed a more consistent relationship with IR/R ratio than with NDVI. The yield prediction is expected to be more valid for ICCV-10 at 66 DAS (R2=0.90**), whereas ICCV-88202 and ICCC-37 are similar for such a prediction both at 66 DAS (V2, R2=0.66*; V3, R2=0.81**) and 84 DAS (V2, R2=0.66*; V3, R2=0.78**).

The use of the Remote Sensing methodology in the state is in operation since 1986-87 and the results have demonstrated the applicability of this technique for early stage assessment of acreage and production of wheat at the state and district levels. A comparison of remote sensing-based production forecast showed good agreement with the conventional estimates made by Bureau of Economics and Statistics at the state level, although district level deviations were larger due to variation in satellite data acquisition dates and non-availability of required Agrometeorological data at the district level used as inputs in yield prediction models. One of the most serious problems faced during some years is the non availability of cloud free data of required period which causes delays in the finalisation of estimates or cancellation of estimation exercises. The persistent cloudy weather hampered the acquisition of data for the whole state in 1993-94 and 1994-95 and acreage and production estimates using remote sensing technology could be undertaken only for eight and seven districts respectively. In order to give reliable estimates of acreage and production, the Punjab Agricultural University constituted an expert group during 1996-97 wheat season to consolidate the information on various aspects of wheat production collected by the State Agriculture Department, Punjab Agricultural University and the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre. The expert group, based on ground information and remote sensing-based results, gave the final estimates of wheat acreage and production for the years 1996-97 and 1997-98 well ahead of harvesting. The production estimates given in 1996-97 were quite close to the actual production finally reported by the State Agriculture Department.

A linear yield-spectral index model has been developed wherein radiance values have been used instead of digital counts in order to take care of data from different satellites/sensors. The spectral ratios have been normalized using a crop growth profile so that alt the values correspond to maximum vegetative growth. Using these procedures district-wise grain yield prediction of wheat for the Haryana state in India for the 1988-89 growing season was carried out. Yield estimates from Landsat MSS and IRS-IA LISS-1 data were in good agreement with one another. The maximum deviation of estimated yield by IRS-IA data from that of Bureau of Economics and Statistics (BES) of the government was 18 per cent. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Agriculture; Crops; Forecasting; Mathematical models; Multispectral scanners; Crop growth profile; Indian remote sensing satellite IRS-1A; Landsat MSS; Spectral index model; Wheat yield; Remote sensing; crop growth profile; IRS; radiance value; wheat yield prediction; India, Haryana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027789123

Besides the quantum of rainfall, the timely commencement of rainy season (onset of monsoon) has also dominating influence on the yield of crops. Timely sowing especially in case of crops grown under rainfed condition gives better yields. It is therefore necessary that the beginning of cropping season is linked with the first monsoon rainfall which would provide the required moisture for the sowing operations. The most variable nature of onset and subsequent behaviour of summer monsoon season makes the task difficult for the farmers and planners to plan their cropping strategies and to estimate the final yield. The year to year variability of dates of onset of monsoon over different parts of India have been studied based on satellite derived data. The yield of different crops under early, normal and late onset are also studied. Delayed onset, is found to have adverse effect on the yields. © 1993.",,"monsoon season; remote sensing; yield prediction; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027518983
